# Deep Learning Directory
This folder contains a from-scratch DNN class written entirely in NumPy. This was a primer designed to get me familiar with how neural networks operate from a ground zero mathematical standpoint. 

Additionally this directory contains the following subdirectories:

1. __learning pytorch__: A collection of jupyter notebooks that iteratively work through the basics of PyTorch. The first notebook is a primer on the Tensor data structure, and each follow on notebook builds on the previous in order to build and train neural networks in the later notebooks.
